# Googlester
Script made just for fun to automaticly put Google Search queries by cities of Ukraine and save suggested results as images.
Script uses Selenium WebDriver and Firefox browser under Windows OS.

**googlester.py** - generate raw images from browser queries

**imagetrimmer.py** - trims resulting images to special crop box
